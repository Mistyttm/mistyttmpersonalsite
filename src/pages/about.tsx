                        Hi there üê∂!!!! My name is Emmey Leo, 19. Online I go by
                        the moniker of Misty Rose. I'm a currently enrolled 2nd
                        year student in a bachelors of IT at QUT and I'm
                        studying a major of computer science.

                        I enjoy studying the process in which games are created
                        in my free time as well as playing them. I also enjoy
                        music, as a cellist of over 10 years now, I have a bit
                        of experience in it. Knowing music has many
                        transferrable skills to my programming which has greatly
                        helped me over the years.
                    </p>
                    <p className="mb-4">
                        I am versed in languages such as JavaScript, Typescript,
                        CSS, Tailwind, Python, C#, MySQL and I have some
                        experince in other languages like C, C++ and Java. I do
                        have a main focus in wanting to create video games as
                        it's my ultimate passion to be able to entertain people.
                        However I am also competent in web design and
                        development, software development and UX/UI. I am
                        capable of really quickly learning any language thrown
                        at me and using my problem solving skills to solve
                        complex digital problems.
                    </p>
                    <p>
